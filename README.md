# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge the gap between traditional economic theory and modern data science techniques.

## About This Portfolio

As an economics student passionate about data-driven decision making, I'm building skills that combine **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**. This repository documents my exploration of how foundational statistical concepts scale into powerful machine learning applications.

The course follows a **"Concept Extension" approach**: we start with core econometric principles (like regression analysis) and extend them using ML algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods). This framework helps me understand not just *how* to apply these tools, but *when* and *why* they're appropriate for economic questions.

Through hands-on labs and projects, I'm developing the technical skills and economic intuition needed for roles in **data analysis, economic consulting, and finance**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio leverages modern tools for economic data analysis:

- **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language for analysis and modeling
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning implementations
- **Statsmodels** – Econometric modeling and statistical tests
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based development environment

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Ongoing

- `labs/` – Weekly lab assignments applying statistical and ML concepts
- `projects/` – Larger projects integrating multiple techniques
- `notes/` – Key insights and methodology documentation

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

- Scaling traditional econometric methods with machine learning
- Balancing prediction accuracy with causal interpretation
- Applying regularization techniques to economic data
- Model selection and validation in real-world contexts
